A Custom Shell Implementation

Minishell is a custom shell implementation project written in C. It aims to provide a simple yet powerful shell interface for executing commands and managing processes. By working on Minishell, you will gain a deep understanding of process management, file descriptors, and command execution.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Command Prompt:** Minishell provides a user-friendly prompt where you can enter commands and interact with the shell.
- **Command History:** Easily navigate and repeat previously executed commands using the history feature.
- **Command Execution:** Minishell can search for and launch the appropriate executables based on the PATH variable or specified paths.
- **Redirection:** Redirect input from files or redirect output to files using the <, >, <<, and >> operators.
- **Pipes:** Create command pipelines by connecting the output of one command to the input of another using the pipe (|) operator.
- **Environment Variable Expansion:** Expand environment variables (e.g., $HOME, $PATH) to their corresponding values.
- **Signal Handling:** Handle signals like ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\ to provide expected behavior for an interactive shell.
- **Built-in Commands:** Minishell includes built-in commands like echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit for essential functionality.
- **Norm Compliance:** The project adheres to coding standards and norms, ensuring clean and readable code.
- **Memory Management:** Minishell takes care of dynamically allocated memory to avoid leaks and ensure efficient resource utilization.

## Why Minishell?

Working on the Minishell project offers valuable experience and showcases skills that employers seek in software developers:

- **Process Management:** Gain hands-on experience with creating child processes, managing their execution, and handling signals.
- **System Calls and File Descriptors:** Become familiar with system calls, file descriptors, and I/O operations, enhancing your low-level programming skills.
- **Problem Solving:** Solve complex problems related to parsing commands, handling input/output, and managing processes efficiently.
- **Debugging and Testing:** Develop proficiency in debugging techniques and writing effective test cases to ensure correctness and reliability.
- **Attention to Detail:** Strict adherence to coding standards, norms, and project requirements demonstrates your attention to detail and commitment to quality code.
